## dsPIC33C Touch CAN LIN Curiosity Development Board - Touch CAN-FD Demo

![Board](images/board.png)

## Summary

This project demonstrates the touch functions on dsPIC33C Touch CAN LIN Curiosity Development Board using MCC- Melody driver code.

Demo code will indicate the touch position of the slider via on-board general purpose LEDs. LED1 switches on when the left most slider is pressed. LED 2-3-4-5 switches on as the touch moves towards right. Touch position is sent to CAN-FD bus.

The on-board potentiometer position is also transferred to CAN-FD bus.

## Software Used

- [MPLAB® X IDE v6.05](https://www.microchip.com/mplabx) or newer
- [MPLAB® XC16 v2.00](https://www.microchip.com/xc16) or newer

## Hardware Used

- [dsPIC33C Touch CAN LIN Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/EV97U97A)

## Setup

**Hardware Setup**

- Connect micro-USB cable to port `J1` of Curiosity board to PC to program the device and for viewing debug messages.
- Connect CAN-FD analyzer to `J11` of Curiosity board via DB9 serial connector
- [Click here](images/hardware_setup.png) to view the hardware setup.

**MPLAB® X IDE Setup**

- Open the `dspic33c-touch-can-lin-curiosity-touch-can-fd-demo.X` project in MPLAB® X IDE
- Build and program the device

**CAN FD Analyzer Tool Setup**

- Configure CAN-FD analyzer clock to 1 Mbps nominal bit-rate and 5 Mbps data bit-rate
- Start the analyzer log to view the frames

## Operation

- When the touch position is at the left most part of the slider, LED1 turns on as the touch of the slider is moved towards right LED2-3-4-5 turns on sequentially. When touch slider is moved from right most to left most these are turned off sequentially.
- The touch value varying from 0 to 256 is sent to CAN bus every 10 ms with the message ID 0x100 (256 in decimal)
- Potentiometer value varying from 0 to 4096 is also sent to CAN bus every 10 ms with the message ID 0x200 (512 in decimal)
- Green LED blink indicates successful receive and transmit of the CAN FD message.
- Red LED On indicates CAN node is in Error state or there is Recieve Overflow error or CAN Transmit failed.

To view received and transmitted frames from CAN FD peripheral in serial terminal for debug purposes, define `UARTDEBUG_ON` in `demo_config.h`.
